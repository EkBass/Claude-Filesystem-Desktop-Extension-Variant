> **Note:** This guide assumes familiarity with navigating system directories and manually replacing files.

To apply the changes, you just need to download two files from this repository.\
Paths may vary depending of your computer set-up.

1. Locate the extension on your computer.
I had it: *C:\Users\ekvir\AppData\Roaming\Claude\Claude Extensions\ant.dir.ant.anthropic.filesystem*

2. Replace *manifest.json* in this directory with the one in this repo.
3. CD to *C:\Users\ekvir\AppData\Roaming\Claude\Claude Extensions\ant.dir.ant.anthropic.filesystem\node_modules\@modelcontextprotocol\server-filesystem\dist*
4. Replace *index.js* with the one in this repo.
5. If your Claude Desktop is running, close it.
6. Close it well.
7. Restart.
